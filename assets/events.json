Key aspects of Japanese Pop Culture include anime, manga, food, music and fashion. We aim to build a better understanding of Japanese culture for our local audience, while providing a platform for up and coming creators to display their abilities.\n\nThis is done by moving away from the traditional ‘convention’ format and recreating the matsuri atmosphere from Japan. Following in the steps of its sister event, Kodomo no Hi Japan Festival, we aim to provide a range of authentic modern Japanese festival food and activities.\n\nWe also strongly believe in giving people, especially young and inexperienced people, opportunities to develop themselves.  This is demonstrated by our enthusiastic and passionate sub-committee members and volunteers who work to make the festival happen.\n\n💙 This event was aggregated by the Eventsia team to help the community find the best local events 💙\n\nHost: Anime GO!\nOfficial Website: https://animego.com.au/\n\nOrganisers: To claim this event, sign up to Eventsia and contact us at info@eventsia.solutions or @eventsia.solutions via Instagram",

    "description": "Welcome, Traveller, to the Kingdom of Valendor\n\nJoin us as we celebrate the Festival of the Second Sun\n\nStep beyond the ordinary and into the shimmering realms of Valendor, where ancient forests whisper, dragons stir upon distant peaks, and magic weaves through every banner-filled street. For two wondrous days, the Melbourne RenFair becomes the beating heart of the Festival of the Second Sun, the most cherished celebration in all the kingdom.\n\nOnce each turning of the seasons, the people of Valendor gather from every duchy to rejoice, feast, trade, and share in the enchantment of new beginnings. As the celestial light of the Second Sun begins to dim, the skies herald a time of reflection, revelry, and renewal. And now, this ancient tradition calls to you.\n\nThe Yarra Valley Racecourse is transformed into the mystical grounds of the Festival of the Second Sun. Here, colourful tents and timbered stalls line the winding pathways as though a living medieval village has sprung from the earth itself.\n\nWander through the Great Goblin Bazaar, a sprawling marketplace buzzing with over 140 artisans, merchants, tinkers, conjurers, smiths, and creators of curious wonders. Discover a carefully curated market filled with handcrafted treasures, gleaming armour, enchanted trinkets, whimsical art, fine garments, and relics from distant lands.\n\nFollow the sound of lutes, drums, and laughter as jesters, bards, and storytellers dance through the lanes, weaving tales of ancient heroes and mischievous spirits. Around every corner, costumed characters bring Valendor to life, welcoming you into their world with charm, chaos, and a touch of magic.\n\nNo festival in Valendor would be complete without contests of strength and daring.\nThe Tournament of the Golden Laurel is a grand jousting competition, where knights thunder across the lists, lances poised, each vying for the sacred Golden Laurel blessed by the high priestess of Lysandra.\n\nThe Melee of the Sun is a glorious clash of skill and might, where warriors battle for honor, renown, and the chance to earn royal favour.Witness thrilling combat demonstrations, test your aim at the archery range, watch blacksmith forging, revel in spellcasting theatrics, and encounter creatures both wondrous and wild, awaiting those bold enough to step forward.\n\nThe Melbourne RenFair is truly a Gathering of Magic, Mystery, and Unity.\n\nThough each duchy holds its own customs, rivalries, and ambitions, the Festival of the Second Sun brings all of Valendor together as one. Nobles forge alliances, artisans showcase their craft, inventors unveil new marvels, and families walk side by side beneath colourful banners.\n\nFor a brief moment in time, the whole kingdom stands together in harmony.\n\nAdventure Awaits, Traveller\nWhether you arrive as a wandering peasant, a noble lord, or simply as yourself, the gates of Valendor are open.\nThe Festival of the Second Sun welcomes all who seek wonder, joy, magic, and discovery.\n\nWill you answer the call and join us at the Melbourne RenFair?\n\n💙 This event was aggregated by the Eventsia team to help the community find the best local events 💙\n\nHost: Melbourne Renfair \nOfficial Website: https://renfair.au/\n\nOrganisers: To claim this event, sign up to Eventsia and contact us at info@eventsia.solutions or @eventsia.solutions via Instagram",
